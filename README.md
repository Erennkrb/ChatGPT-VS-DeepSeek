# ChatGPT-VS-DeepSeek AI

Welcome to the **ChatGPT-VS-DeepSeek AI** repository! This project is a fun and interactive comparison between two powerful AI models, **ChatGPT** and **DeepSeek**, to see which one performs better in creating Python Tkinter games. The goal is to evaluate their creativity, coding skills, and ability to follow instructions.

---

## **Overview**

I asked both ChatGPT and DeepSeek to create Python Tkinter games based on specific prompts. Each round focuses on different aspects of game development, such as visuals, functionality, and user experience. Here's a breakdown of the results:

---

## **Round 1**

### **Prompt:**
> "Make a Python Tkinter game. I'm just saying: make it look good, and you can use your own idea on what you wanna do. Go ahead!"

### **Results:**

- **ChatGPT**: Created a game called **"Avoid the Falling Blocks"**. The concept was simple: avoid red blocks falling from the top of the screen. The game was functional but lacked visual appeal.
  
- **DeepSeek**: Created a game called **"Catch the Falling Food"**. Instead of blocks, DeepSeek used **emoji sprites** (like fruits üçé, üçå) and added a scoring system. The hitboxes weren't perfect, but the game was visually more engaging.

### **Comparison:**

| Criteria          | ChatGPT       | DeepSeek      |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Faster Reply**  | ‚ùå            | ‚úÖ            |
| **Better Visuals**| ‚ùå            | ‚úÖ            |
| **Game Idea**     | ‚ùå            | ‚úÖ            |
| **More Fun?**     | ‚úÖ (Personal preference) | ‚ùå (But offers a score system) |
| **Chat UI**       | ‚úÖ            | ‚ùå            |

### **Winner: DeepSeek AI** üèÜ  
**Score: DeepSeek 4 : 1 ChatGPT**

## **Round 2**

### **Prompt:**
> "That's cool! But now spend more time thinking. Make another game with better looks, better 'funability,' and also user experience. Make a menu with options like quit and start. Add what you want. The game name should be on the menu top. Think for bug fixes. I'm gonna give you time, and file size doesn't matter. Go as crazy as you want. Good luck!"

### **Results:**

- **ChatGPT**: Took the **same game from Round 1** and added a basic menu. It didn't create a new game as requested. After feedback, ChatGPT created a new game called **"Galactic Defender"**, but it had several bugs:
  - Hitboxes were off.
  - Asteroids couldn't kill the player.
  - Asteroids stayed on the ground after landing.

- **DeepSeek**: Created a game called **"Galactic Defender"** (same name as ChatGPT's game). The game had a menu with **Start**, **Quit**, and **Help** options. However, the game crashed due to a bug in the asteroid movement logic.

### **Comparison:**

| Criteria          | ChatGPT       | DeepSeek      |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Creativity**    | ‚ùå (Reused Round 1 game) | ‚úÖ (New game concept) |
| **Bug Fixes**     | ‚ùå (Many bugs) | ‚ùå (Game crashed) |
| **User Experience**| ‚ùå (Basic menu) | ‚úÖ (Detailed menu with Help) |
| **Visuals**       | ‚ùå (Same as Round 1) | ‚úÖ (Improved visuals) |

### **Winner: DeepSeek AI** üèÜ  
Despite the crash, DeepSeek's game had better visuals, a more detailed menu, and a new concept. With some bug fixes, it would be the clear winner.

---

## **Round 2 (Second Chance)**

After reporting the bugs, both models were given a second chance to fix their games.

- **ChatGPT**: Fixed some bugs but still had issues with hitboxes and asteroid behavior.
- **DeepSeek**: Improved the game logic, but yellow dots (bullets) started spawning uncontrollably.

### **Conclusion:**
DeepSeek's game had more potential with its detailed design and menu system. After some personalization and bug fixes, it would be the better game.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

- **DeepSeek** outperformed ChatGPT in both rounds, offering better visuals, more creative ideas, and a faster response time.
- **ChatGPT** struggled with bugs and reused ideas from Round 1, but it provided a more polished chat interface.
- Both models showed surprising similarities in their game concepts, suggesting a possible connection in their training data.
